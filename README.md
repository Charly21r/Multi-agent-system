### Multi-Agent System with OpenAI Agents SDK

This project demonstrates how to build a simple **multi-agent system** using the OpenAI Agents SDK. The assistant helps users plan their travels by:
- Checking for flights.
- Checking the weather for a destination.
- Generating a personalized tourist plan based on current conditions.

This project is designed to be small, modular, and educational ‚Äî perfect for learning how to implement collaborating AI agents with tools.
